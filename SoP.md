- Using IAM, create 'mlapp' user and associate AWS S3FULL Access policy to user(mlapp)
- Create IAM Credentials for same mlapp user(AccessKeyID, SecretAccessKeyID)
$ aws --version # Verify AWS CLI Installation
$ aws configure # Configure AWS CLI to allow program
    - AccessKeyID:
    - SecretAccesskey:
    - region: us-east-2
    - output: json

## AWS ECR Commands
Make sure that you have the latest version of the AWS TOOLS for PowerShell and Docker installed. For more information, see Getting Started with Amazon ECR .
Use the following steps to authenticate and push an image to your repository. For additional registry authentication methods, including the Amazon ECR credential helper, see Registry Authentication .
Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry. Use the AWS TOOLS for PowerShell:
Step 1:
(Get-ECRLoginCommand).Password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 590183798731.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Note: If you receive an error using the AWS TOOLS for PowerShell, make sure that you have the latest version of the AWS TOOLS for PowerShell and Docker installed.
Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:
Step 2: 
docker build -t mlappecr .
After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
Step 3: 
docker tag mlappecr:latest 590183798731.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mlappecr:latest
Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
Step 4: 
docker push 590183798731.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mlappecr:latest
